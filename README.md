# Awesome Calculator

This is a POC app that serves as a calculator. It takes in an expression and evaluates it taking into account parantheses, order of operations and exception cases.

## Running the App

To test the app, boot up a local server environment and set the root to .../front-end/. This is because Google does not support API calls from a local file environment.
